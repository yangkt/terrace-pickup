# ChewQueue React App

## Idea

Hi! We are 4 Cornell students dedicated to improving the user experience of ordering from our favorite places on campus! The lines in Mac’s Cafe and for the burrito bowl at Terrace are always overcrowded during peak lunch times and in the interest of public health, we created this online ordering system to de-densify these crowded areas!
ChewQueue is an online ordering web app with quality UI/UX and accurate pickup time estimate that hosts both restaurant and customer side.

## How to run
You’ll need to have Node 8.16.0 or Node 10.16.0 or later version on your local development machine, as well as yarn which you can download with `brew install yarn`.
Run the following code for the first time:  
```  
cd react-app
npm install
yarn build
cd ./flask-server
pip3 install flask
python3 main.py
```  
For the rest of the instructions, regarding yarn please view the [full stack workshop](https://github.com/HackOurCampus/fullstack-integration-workshop/blob/master/frontend/README.md)  

## Figma
Our two UI/UX designers created a [Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/YSXPWkmC3BhqieXJ3bdVMZ/Terrace?node-id=0%3A1) of the complete user flow for both the restaurant and user side
